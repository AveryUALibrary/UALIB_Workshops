## Decisions

One way to make choices in how code executes is to use the MATLAB [if,elseif,else](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/if.html) keywords. The general MATLAB syntax for these conditional statements is as follows:

```Matlab

if expression
   do something 1
elseif expression
   do something 2
else
   do something 3
end

```
Expressions generally use [relational operators](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/relational-operators.html) and [logical operators](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/logicaloperatorsshortcircuit.html) to test a condition. Some examples of relational operators include `==` for equality and `>` for greater than. Logical operators allow you to test two conditions, including `||` for OR, and `&&` for AND.

In a conditional `if` statement, the only required keywords to use are `if` and `end`. You do not need to use the `elseif` nor `else` if your code choices do not require multiple decisions. Here is an example:

```Matlab

>> n = 'Alabama';
if length(n) > 5
    disp('n has more than 5 characters')
end 
n has more than 5 characters

```

In the above code, we use the `if` keyword, `length` function, and relational operator `>` to determine if variable `n` has more than 5 characters. If it does, we display `n has more than 5 characters`. If we provide an `n` with a length fewer than 5, the expression is false, and the code will not display anything:

```Matlab

>> n = 'Utah';
if length(n) > 5
    disp('n has more than 5 characters')
end

```

We can add `else` to our code to execute a statement when the first expression is false:

```Matlab

>> n = 'Alabama';
if length(n) > 5
    disp('n has more than 5 characters')
else
    disp('n has less than 5 characters')
end
n has more than 5 characters

>> n = 'Utah';
if length(n) > 5
    disp('n has more than 5 characters')
else
    disp('n has less than 5 characters')
end
n has less than 5 characters
```

We can then add an `elseif` keyword, for example, if we wanted to test the condition that `n` has exactly 5 characters:

```Matlab

>> n = 'Alabama';
if length(n) > 5
    disp('n has more than 5 characters')
elseif length(n) == 5
    disp('n has 5 characters')
else
    disp('n has less than 5 characters')
end
n has more than 5 characters

>> n = 'Utah';
if length(n) > 5
    disp('n has more than 5 characters')
elseif length(n) == 5
    disp('n has 5 characters')
else
    disp('n has less than 5 characters')
end
n has less than 5 characters

>> n = 'Maine';
if length(n) > 5
    disp('n has more than 5 characters')
elseif length(n) == 5
    disp('n has 5 characters')
else
    disp('n has less than 5 characters')
end
n has 5 characters

```

We can use multiple `elseif` keywords to add a test for an empty string:

```n = '';
if length(n) > 5
    disp('n has more than 5 characters')
elseif length(n) == 5
    disp('n has 5 characters')
elseif length(n) == 0
    disp('n has no characters')
else
    disp('n has less than 5 characters')
end
n has no characters
```

With conditional statements, once a condition is true, the code for that condition is executed and no further conditions are tested. So, be sure to experiment often and try a variety of test cases when coding. As an example, let's say we wrote the following code expecting to test for more than 5 characters and the character a:

```
>> n = 'Alabama';
if length(n) > 5
    disp('n has more than 5 characters')
elseif count(n,'a') > 0
    disp('n contains the character a')
else
    disp('n has less than 5 characters and does not contain a')
end
n has more than 5 characters

```

Since the first statement `length(n) > 5` was true, the code executed and stopped, even though the next statement `count(n,'a') > 0` is also true. One way we can test for two conditions at the same time would be to rewrite the code using a logical operator:

```Matlab

>> n = 'Alabama';
if length(n) > 5 && count(n,'a') > 0
    disp('n has more than 5 characters and contains the character a')
else
    disp('false')
end
n has more than 5 characters and contains the character a

>> n = 'Utah';
if length(n) > 5 && count(n,'a') > 0
    disp('n has more than 5 characters and contains the character a')
else
    disp('false')
end
false
```

We can also combine conditional statements with loops:

```Matlab

>> n = {'Alabama','Georgia','Maine','Utah'};
for j = 1:length(n)
    if length(n{j}) > 5
        disp('n has more than 5 characters')
    elseif length(n{j}) == 5
        disp('n has 5 characters')
    else
        disp('n has less than 5 characters')
    end
end
n has more than 5 characters
n has more than 5 characters
n has 5 characters
n has less than 5 characters
```

Let's return to our `myCIDdata` variable and create a new variable by indexing out the first 20 rows of the first column (Isomeric SMILES):

```Matlab

>> smi = myCIDdata{1:20,1}

smi =

  20Ã—1 cell array

    {'CCN(CC(=O)C)C(C1=CC=CC=C1)C(=O)OC(C)(C)C'            }
    {'CCN(CC(=O)OCC)C(C1=CC=CC=C1)C(=O)OC'                 }
    {'C1=CC=C(C=C1)CN(CC2=CC=CC=C2)C(C3=CC=C(C=C3)F)C(=O)O'}
    {'CC.CCCN1CCN(CC1)C(C2=CC=CC=C2CC)C(=O)O'              }
    {'CC.CC.CCC.CC(=C)N1CCN(CC1)C(C2=CC=CC=C2)C(=O)O'      }
    {'CC.CC(C)N(C)C(CC1=CC=CC=C1)C(=O)O'                   }
    {'CN(C)C(C1=CC=CC=C1C(F)(F)F)C(=O)O.Cl'                }
    {'CC1CCC(=C)N1C(C2=CC=CC=C2)C(=O)O'                    }
    {'CCC(CCN(C)C(C1=CC=CC=C1)C(=O)O)O'                    }
    {'CC=C.CC1=C(C(=CC=C1)C(C(=O)O)N(C)C)C.C#C'            }
    {'CCCC1=C(C(=CC=C1)[C@H](C(=O)O)N2CCCCC2)F'            }
    {'CCN(C)CCN(C)C(C1=CC=CC=C1)C(=O)O'                    }
    {'CC(C)C1CC1C(C(=O)O)N(C)CC2=CC=CC=C2'                 }
    {'CCCC1=CC(=CC=C1)[C@H](C(=O)O)N2CCCCC2'               }
    {'CC(CC=C)(NC(C1=CC=CC=C1)C(=O)O)O'                    }
    {'CC(C)N(CCCCCCCCC(=O)O)CC1=CC=CC=C1'                  }
    {'CC1(CCN(CC1)[C@@H](C2=CC=CC=C2)C(=O)O)O'             }
    {'CCN[C@@H](C1=CC=CC=C1)C(=O)O.Cl'                     }
    {'CCCCCCC(C1=CC=CC=C1)(C(=O)O)N(C)C'                   }
    {'[2H]CC(C)(C)OC(=O)N(CC(=O)O)C(C1=CC=CC=C1)C(=O)O'    }


```

We can apply what we learned about conditional statements to find some patterns in the SMILES strings. For example, if we wanted to display information about SMILES that contain the characters '+' OR '-':
