In general, we reused parts of their lesson including the basic structure, descriptions, and logical ordering, but included our own specific variables, scripts, loops, and custom function examples.

[MathWorks MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) is a complete interactive desktop environment and programming language. MATLAB is used by Mathematicians, Scientists, Engineers and others for numeric computation, data analysis, data visualization, and creation of application. There are also a variety of [add-on toolboxes](https://www.mathworks.com/products.html) for solving specific problems, for example, in computational biology or image processing.

## Access and Installation

The University of Alabama maintains a site license to MATLAB and Simulink, as well as many of the add-on toolboxes. See the [UA Office of Information Technology](https://oit.ua.edu/software/matlab/) website for access and installation instructions. MATLAB is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
